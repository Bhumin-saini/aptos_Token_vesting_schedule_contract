Token Vesting Schedule Contract
Description
This project implements a simple token vesting schedule smart contract on the Aptos blockchain. The contract enables an initializer to lock tokens under a vesting schedule and allows a designated beneficiary to claim tokens gradually based on predefined vesting parameters such as start time, cliff period, and overall duration.

Vision
Our vision is to offer a secure and transparent method for managing token distribution. This contract empowers project creators by ensuring that tokens are released in a controlled manner, mitigating risks associated with immediate large-scale token distributions and fostering trust with token beneficiaries.

Future Scope
Multi-Beneficiary Support: Extend functionality to allow multiple beneficiaries and more complex vesting arrangements.

Dynamic Vesting: Introduce adjustable vesting schedules that can respond to market conditions or project milestones.

User Interface Integration: Develop a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring vesting schedules and claiming tokens.

Extended Token Compatibility: Adapt the contract to support additional token types and standards.

Enhanced Security: Implement further security audits and integrate community feedback to ensure robustness.
